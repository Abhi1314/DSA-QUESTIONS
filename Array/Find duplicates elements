Find duplicates in O(n) time and O(1) extra space | Set 1
//Algorithm: 
//1.Traverse the given array from start to end.
//2.For every element in the array increment the arr[i]%n‘th element by n.
//3.Now traverse the array again and print all those indexes i for which arr[i]/n is greater than 1. Which guarantees that the number n has been added to that index
//4.This approach works because all elements are in the range from 0 to n-1 and arr[i] would be greater than n only if a value “i” has appeared more than once.
